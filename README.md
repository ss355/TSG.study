** The README file for genes identified by Methods A, B, C, and D in our Tumor Supressor Gene (TSG) methylation study. 

** This zip file "Gene.List.by.Methods.ABCD.zip" includes the following folders: 

 (1) Gene.Lists.TEXT, 
 (2) Method_A.Table6.Row1and3, 
 (3) Method_B.Table6.Row2and4, 
 (4) Method_C, 
 (5) Method_D, 
 (6) R.Code.and.Input. 

The corresponding R code and Input to obtain the gene list in "Gene.Lists.TEXT" folder 
are saved in the "Code.for.GeneLists.byAP" folder. 

The corresponding R code and Input to obtain the separate or individual gene list in the other folders 
(i.e., "Method_A.Table6.Row1and3", "Method_B.Table6.Row2and4", "Method_C", "Method_D") are 
saved in the "Code.for.MethodABCD.byCT" folder.
